Colission avoidance system is an automobile safety system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision.
It monitors a vehicle's speed, the speed of a vehicle in front of it, and the distance between the vehicles, 
to provide a warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close so as to avoid a crash.
Here in this project we are using predefined Tensorflow Object Detection API for detection of objects and other puposes and we are using video processing by opencv libraray , this is full working project which gives alert i.e. warning if another vehicle is too near or chanaces of collision increases. Project is capable of working on real world data </br>
Libraries used are :</br>
1. tensorflow      (pip install tensorflow)  
2. matplotlib      (pip install matplotlib)  
3. opencv-python   (pip install opencv-python)   
4. lxml            (pip install lxml
